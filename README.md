# UnlimitedBot

The following bot, Unlimited, as a personal project in order to delve deeper into NodeJS, DiscordJS and learn general programming with JavaScript. 
It was launched on 30.04.2020 and the files in Documents/Unlimited contain 3 main components:

(a) index.js - key file which provides location of other folders and files to access commands
 - functions.js 
(b) supplementary folders such as fun and general commands - each file for example addrole.js links to a command run by a user on Discord chat, as !addrole [USER] [ROLE] where ! is an example of a prefix.
(c) node modules - these are the node modules and discordJS libraries used to implement code.
